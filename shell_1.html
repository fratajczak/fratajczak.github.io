	<h1>Implementing a shell from scratch in C</h1>
</header>

<main>
	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Making your own Unix shell like bash, zsh or fish with cool features 
			such as redirections, pipes or job control using only basic C stdlib 
			functions and syscalls</li>
		<li>Learning how the shell you use everyday works internally in order to
			master it</li>
		<li>Having fun in the process (hopefully)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		This is not meant to be a C tutorial, so I'll assume you have a basic
		understanding of C, but will try my best to explain the core concepts, 
		functions and syscalls we'll be using.
	</p>

	<h2>The basics</h2>

	<h4>What's a shell?</h4>
	<p>
		A <b>shell</b> is a program that runs on a terminal and allows you to 
		easily run and combine commands.
	</p>
	<p>
		A <b>terminal</b> sends keyboard input to a program and displays the 
		characters it receives on your screen.
	</p>


	<p>
		A shell runs on an infinite loop with the following basic steps:
		<ul>
			<li>Read input from the user, usually one line,</li>
			<li>Parse the line to see what commands it should run,</li>
			<li>Run the commands and repeat.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h4>Getting input from the terminal</h4>
	<p>
		To read input from the terminal, we will use the <code>read(2)</code>
		system call.<br>
		<code>$> man 2 read</code> tells us:
	</p>
	<pre><code class="plaintext">
SYNOPSIS
	#include &lt;unistd.h>

	ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);

DESCRIPTION
	read() attempts to read up to count bytes from file descriptor fd into
	the buffer starting at buf.

RETURN VALUE
	On success, the number of bytes read is returned (zero  indicates  end
	of file), and the file position is advanced by this number.
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		<i>(man pages section 2 is dedicated to syscalls)</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		The file descriptor associated to the input from the terminal is
		number 0, also referred to as standard input or stdin. The terminal
		output, or stdout, is associated to file descriptor 1.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's start by making our own crappy version of <code>cat</code>:
	</p>
	<pre><code class="C">
#include &lt;unistd.h>

int main()
{
	int ret;
	char buf[128];

	do {
		ret = read(STDIN_FILENO, buf, 127);
		buf[ret + 1] = '\0';
		write(STDOUT_FILENO, buf, ret);
	} while (ret > 0);
}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		<code>STDIN_FILENO</code> and <code>STDOUT_FILENO</code> are macros
		defined in <code>unistd.h</code>, they evaluate to 0 and 1 respectively.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that read does not NULL-terminate buf, so we have to do it
		ourselves (this is not necessary here, because write only writes as many
		characters as necessary, but it will be later).
	</p>
	<p>
		If you try compiling and running this program, you'll see it only writes
		the input after you press enter or Ctrl-D , because <code>read</code> 
		doesn't return until then (Ctrl-D sends the end of transmission
		character to your terminal). If you press Ctrl-D on an empty line,
		<code>read</code> considers it as the end of file and returns 0, so the
		program exits.
	</p>
	<p>
		As you can see, only using <code>read</code> still gives us some
		very basic line editing by default. Later on, we'll have to disable this
		to implement our own advanced line editing, but for now, this will do.
	</p>

	<h4>Executing commands</h4>

	<h5>1. execv()</h5>

	<p>
		To execute a command, we'll use <code>execv(2)</code>.
		Its prototype is <br>
		<code>int execv(const char *path, char *const argv[]);</code>
		<ul>
			<li><code>path</code> is a path to a binary</li>
			<li><code>argv</code> is a NULL-terminated array of arguments.</li>
			<li><code>argv[0]</code> is the name that the user used to invoke
				the command.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		If we wanted to execute <code>cat -e /etc/passwd</code>, we would do:
	</p>
	<pre><code class="C">
#include &lt;unistd.h>

int main()
{
	char *argv[] = {"cat", "-e", "/etc/passwd", NULL};

	execv("/bin/cat", argv);
	write(STDOUT_FILENO, "Executed cat!\n", 14);
}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		If you try executing this program, you will see that it executes cat,
		but the "Executed cat!" message does not appear. Why does this happen?
		As is often the case, the answer lies within the man pages:
	</p>
	<pre><code class="plaintext">
DESCRIPTION
	The exec() family of functions replaces the current process image with a
	new process image.
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This means our program is completely replaced by cat, which makes our
		would-be shell a bit useless.
	</p>

	<h5>2. fork()</h5>
	<p>
		The solution to this problem is yet another syscall, <code>fork(2)</code>.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="plaintext">
NAME
	fork - create a child process

SYNOPSIS
	#include &lt;sys/types.h>
	#include &lt;unistd.h>

	pid_t fork(void);

DESCRIPTION
	fork()  creates  a new process by duplicating the calling process.  The
	new process is referred to as the child process.  The  calling  process
	is referred to as the parent process.
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The child process created is an exact duplicate of the parent process.
		It has the same variables, open file descriptors and starts at the same
		point in execution as the parent process when it called fork. However,
		if you modify a variable in the child or parent process after forking,
		no changes are applied to the other process.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fork returns the process id (or pid) of the child process if we are in 
		the parent process, but if we are in the child process, it returns 0.
		This can be used to execute a bit of code only in the fork.
	</p>
	<p>
		We then just need to fork a new process before calling <code>execv</code>,
		our code becomes:
	</p>
	<pre><code class="C">
#include &lt;unistd.h>
#include &lt;sys/types.h>

int main()
{
	int pid;
	char *argv[] = {"cat", "-e", "/etc/passwd", NULL};

	pid = fork();
	if (pid == 0) {
		execv("/bin/cat", argv);
	}
	write(STDOUT_FILENO, "Executed cat!\n", 14);
}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		One last problem remains: even though our <code>write()</code> is after
		the <code>execve</code> in the code, we get this output:
	</p>
	<pre><code>
Executed cat!
root:x:0:0::/root:/bin/bash$
bin:x:1:1::/:/usr/bin/nologin$
daemon:x:2:2::/:/usr/bin/nologin$
[...]
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		That's because the parent process just goes past the if condition
		(which is only true in the child process), and continues its execution
		without waiting for the child process to finish.
	</p>

	<h5>3. wait()</h5>

	<p>
		In order to wait for the child process to finish before resuming 
		execution in the parent process, we'll use the aptly-named
		<code>wait(2)</code> syscall.<br>
		<code>wait</code> takes an <code>int *</code> as argument, in which
		it stores information about the first child process that changed status,
		and returns this child process' pid. <br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Since we don't need any information for now, we'll juste use
		<code>wait(NULL);</code>, which will still wait for a child process, but
		won't give us any information about it other than its pid.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="C">
#include &lt;unistd.h>
#include &lt;sys/types.h>
#include &lt;sys/wait.h>

int main()
{
	int pid;
	char *argv[] = {"cat", "-e", "/etc/passwd", NULL};

	pid = fork();
	if (pid == 0) {
		execv("/bin/cat", argv);
	}
	wait(NULL);
	write(STDOUT_FILENO, "Executed cat!\n", 14);
}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		It finally works like we wanted it to! Now we just need to combine
		everything we learned and we'll have a working shell.
	</p>

	<h4>Putting it all together</h4>

	<p>
		We'll just need to get input from the user, split the command line into
		an array of strings (argv) using <code>strtok(3)</code>, execute it,
		and loop. Keep in mind we'll have to execute commands by typing in their
		full path for now, e.g <code>/usr/bin/cat test</code>, not
		<code>cat test</code>.<br>
		You can try doing this yourself first, but if you're stuck, here's a 
		solution:
	</p>
	<pre><code class="C">
//read, fork, write, execv
#include &lt;unistd.h>
//fork
#include &lt;sys/types.h>
//wait
#include &lt;sys/wait.h>
//perror
#include &lt;stdio.h>
//malloc
#include &lt;stdlib.h>
//strtok
#include &lt;string.h>

char **get_argv(char *input)
{
	char **argv = NULL;
	char *token;
	size_t word_count = 0;
	size_t i = 0;

	while (input[i] == ' '){
		i++;
	}

	while (input[i]) {
		if (input[i] == ' ' || input[i] == '\n'){
			word_count++;
			while (input[i] == ' ' || input[i] == '\n'){
				i++;
			}
		}
		i++;
	}
	if (word_count == 0){
		return NULL;
	}

	argv = malloc(sizeof(char *) * (word_count + 1));
	if (argv) {
		token = strtok(input, " \n");
		i = 0;
		while (token) {
			argv[i] = token;
			token = strtok(NULL, " \n");
			i++;
		}
	}
	return argv;
}

int main()
{
	int pid;
	int ret;
	char buf[128];
	char **argv;

	do {
		write(STDOUT_FILENO, "$> ", 3); //write a prompt
		ret = read(STDIN_FILENO, buf, 127);
		buf[ret + 1] = '\0';
		argv = get_argv(buf);
		if (argv) {
			pid = fork();
			if (pid == 0) {
				execv(argv[0], argv);
				perror(argv[0]);
			}
			wait(NULL);
		}
	} while (ret > 0);
}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Note that: 
	</p>
	<pre><code class="C">
execv(argv[0], argv);
perror(argv[0]);
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		is equivalent to:
	</p>
	<pre><code class="C">
if (execv(argv[0], argv) == -1) //check if execv failed
	perror(argv[0]);
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Because if <code>execv</code> succeeds, the process is no longer our
		shell and <code>perror</code> will never be executed.
	</p>
	<p>
		We finally have something that kind of looks like a shell. Next up,
		environment variables and <code>$PATH</code>!
	</p>
</main>
